# Ballyhoo-Bulletin

Need plumbing done but can't afford it? Are you great at landscaping? What about that extra coffee table you don't need? 

Ballyhoo Bulletin is the place to go to trade goods and services. If you are great at landscaping but your plumbing skills suffer, you can make a post on Ballyhoo to swap services. Or, if you have extra items lying around, you can trade good for good, or goods for services.
